 * Question ? http://www.corejavainterviewquestions.com/idiots-guide-big-o/
 * ==========
 * I have an array of the numbers 1 to 100 in a random number. One of the numbers is missing.
 * Write an algorithm to figure out what the number is and what position is missing.

 * There are many variations of this question all of which are very popular.
 * To calculate the missing number we can simply add up all the numbers we do have,
 * and subtract this from the expected answer of the sum of all numbers between 1 and 100.

 * To do this we have to iterate the list once. Whilst doing this we can also note which spot has the gap.
 *
 * What is the big O of your algo?
  ==================================
    Our algorithm iterates through our list once, so itâ€™s simply O(n).
