 *
 *  The Boyer Moore algorithm does preprocessing the pattern
 *  It preporcesses the pattern and creates different arrays
 *  Boyer Moore algorithm starts matching from the last character of the pattern.
 *
 *
 * Maximum of Good-suffix and Bad-Character shifts
 Boyer-Moore needs both good-suffix and bad-character shifts in order to speed up searching performance.
 After a mismatch, the maximum of both is considered in order to move the pattern to the right.

 Complexity
 Itâ€™s clear that Boyer-Moore is faster than Morris-Pratt, but actually
 its worst-case complexity is O(n+m).
 The thing is that in natural language search, Boyer-Moore does pretty well.
