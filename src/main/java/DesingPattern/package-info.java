 * FACTORY Method (Creational)
 * ===========================
 *
 * Defination ?
 * ------------
 *
 *
 * Implementation ?
 * ----------------
 * Define an interface for creating an object, but let the subclasses
 * decide which class to instantiate.
 *
 * Where/When to use the pattern ?
 * -------------------------------
 * The idea behind the Factory Method pattern is that it allows for the case
 * where a client doesn't know what concrete classes it will be required to create at runtim
 *
 *
 * How to use the pattern ?
 * -------------------------
 *
 *
 * What is going to solve the problem ?
 * ------------------------------------
 *
 *
 * Example : API level
 * --------------------
 *
 *
 * You'll see factories used in logging frameworks, and in a lot of scenarios where the client doesn't
 * need to know about the concrete implementations. It's a good approach to encapsulation.
