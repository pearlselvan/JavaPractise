 * Ask question is it sorted or not ?
 *
 * SORTED :
 * ========
 * http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/remove-occurrences-duplicates-sorted-linked-list/

 * UNSORTED :
 * ========
 * http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/remove-duplicates-from-an-unsorted-linked-list/
 *
 * METHOD 1 (Using two loops)
 * =========================
    This is the simple way where two loops are used.
    Outer loop is used to pick the elements one by one and inner loop compares the picked element
    with rest of the elements.
