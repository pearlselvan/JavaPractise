 1. We can get all keys in sorted order by just doing Inorder Traversal of BST.
 This is not a natural operation in Hash Tables and requires extra efforts.
 2.Doing order statistics, finding closest lower and greater elements, doing range queries are easy
 to do with BSTs. Like sorting, these operations are not a natural operation with Hash Tables.

 3. BSTs are easy to implement compared to hashing, we can easily implement our own customized BST. To implement Hashing, we generally rely on libraries provided by programming languages.
 4. With BSTs, all operations are guaranteed to work in O(Logn) time. But with Hashing, Θ(1) is average time and some particular operations may be costly, especially when table resizing happens.
