 Algorithem :
 Recursively check if left or right child has path sum equal to ( number â€“ value at current node)


 Simple :
 -------
 The basic idea is to subtract the value of current node from sum until it
 reaches a leaf node and the subtraction equals 0, then we know that we got a hit.
 Otherwise the subtraction at the end could not be 0.
