//Binary trees have a few interesting properties when they're perfect:
//Property 1: the number of total nodes on each "level"
// doubles as we move down the tree.
//Property 2: the number of nodes on the last level is equal
// to the sum of the number of nodes on all other levels (plus 1).
// In other words, about half of our nodes are on the last level.
