  Queue is a particular kind of abstract data type or collection in which the entities
  in the collection are kept in order and the principal (or only) operations on the collection
  are the addition of entities to the rear terminal position, known as enqueue, and removal
  of entities from the front terminal position, known as dequeue.
  This makes the queue a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure.

 Stack is a particular kind of abstract data type or collection in which the principal
 (or only) operations on the collection are the addition of an entity to the collection,
 known as push and removal of an entity, known as pop.
 The relation between the push and pop operations is such that the stack is a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO)
 data structure.
