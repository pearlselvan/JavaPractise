 * 1. DFS Using Stack
 *
 *
 * 2. DFS Using Recursive
 *
 *
 * http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/depth-first-traversal-for-a-graph/ , This is for coding , implemented ising list
 * The only catch here is, unlike trees, graphs may contain cycles,
 * so we may come to the same node again. To avoid processing a node more than once,
 * we use a boolean visited array.
   For example, in the following graph, we start traversal from vertex 2. When we come
   to vertex 0, we look for all adjacent vertices of it. 2 is also an adjacent
   vertex of 0. If we donâ€™t mark visited vertices, then 2 will be processed
   again and it will become a non-terminating process.
   A Depth First Traversal of the following graph is 2, 0, 1, 3.
