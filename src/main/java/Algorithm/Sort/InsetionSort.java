/**
 * Created by muthuselvan on 2/20/17.
 * Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted
 * array one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists
 * than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.
 * Every repetition of insertion sort removes an element from the input data,
 * inserting it into the correct position in the already-sorted list,
 * until no input elements remain. The choice of which element to remove
 * from the input is arbitrary, and can be made using almost any choice algorithm.
 * You can see the code implementation below: -
