 *
 *  External sorting is a term for a class of sorting algorithms that can handle massive amounts of data.
 *  External sorting is required when the data being sorted do not fit into the main memory of a computing
 *  device (usually RAM) and instead they must reside in the slower external memory (usually a hard drive).
 *
 *  External sorting typically uses a hybrid sort-merge strategy. In the sorting phase, chunks of data small enough
 *  to fit in main memory are read, sorted, and written out to a temporary file. In the merge phase,
 *  the sorted sub-files are combined into a single larger file.
